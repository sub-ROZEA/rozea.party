# About

I draw robots :] (or I guess more specifically androids)

## The Name

The name "sub.ROZEA" comes from the Latin term "sub rosa", but instead it's in Ido (the constructed language based on Esperanto). The capitalization is based off of [ARM's big.LITTLE](https://www.arm.com/technologies/big-little).

## Software I Use

I pretty much stick with free / open source software.

- [Krita](https://krita.org) - My main tool for drawing.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Vector work
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) - Touching up after I finish my drawing in Krita / Inkscape.
- [Blender](https://blender.org) - 3D work
- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) - Static site generator
- [Oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) - Optimize PNG images
