# About

I draw robots :] (or I guess more specifically androids)

## The Name

The name "sub.ROZEA" comes from the Latin term "sub rosa", but instead it's in Ido (the constructed language based on Esperanto). The capitalization is based off of [ARM's big.LITTLE](https://www.arm.com/technologies/big-little).
